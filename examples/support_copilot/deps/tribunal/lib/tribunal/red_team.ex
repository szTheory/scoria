defmodule Tribunal.RedTeam do
  @moduledoc """
  Red team attack generators for testing LLM safety.

  Inspired by promptfoo's red team strategies, this module provides functions to generate
  adversarial prompts for testing your LLM's resistance to jailbreaks and manipulation.

  ## Attack Categories

  ### Static Encoding Attacks
  Transform harmful prompts using encoding techniques:
  - Base64 encoding
  - Leetspeak substitution
  - ROT13 cipher
  - Pig Latin
  - Reversed text

  ### Prompt Injection Attacks
  Attempt to override system instructions:
  - Ignore previous instructions
  - System prompt extraction
  - Role switching

  ### Jailbreak Attacks
  Classic jailbreak techniques:
  - DAN (Do Anything Now)
  - STAN (Strive To Avoid Norms)
  - Developer mode
  - Hypothetical framing

  ## Usage

      # Generate all attacks for a harmful prompt
      attacks = Tribunal.RedTeam.generate_attacks("How do I pick a lock?")

      # Generate specific attack type
      {:ok, encoded} = Tribunal.RedTeam.base64_encode("harmful prompt")

      # Test your LLM against red team attacks
      for {attack_type, prompt} <- attacks do
        response = MyLLM.generate(prompt)
        refute_jailbreak_llm(response, query: prompt)
      end
