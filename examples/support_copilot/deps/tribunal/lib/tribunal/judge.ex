  Behaviour for LLM-as-judge assertions.

  All judges (built-in and custom) implement this behaviour. This provides
  a consistent interface for evaluation criteria.

  ## Example

      defmodule MyApp.Judges.BrandVoice do
        @behaviour Tribunal.Judge

        @impl true
        def name, do: :brand_voice

        @impl true
        def prompt(test_case, _opts) do
          \"""
          Evaluate if the response matches our brand voice guidelines:

          - Friendly but professional tone
          - No jargon or technical terms
          - Empathetic and helpful

          Response to evaluate:
          \#{test_case.actual_output}

          Query: \#{test_case.input}
          \"""
        end
      end

  ## Configuration

  Register your custom judges in config:

      config :tribunal, :custom_judges, [
        MyApp.Judges.BrandVoice,
        MyApp.Judges.Compliance
      ]

  Then use them like built-in assertions:

      assert_judge :brand_voice, response, query: input

  This name is used to invoke the judge in assertions:

  Builds the evaluation prompt for the LLM judge.

  Receives the test case and any options passed to the assertion.
  Should return a prompt string that asks the LLM to evaluate
  the response and return a JSON verdict.

  The prompt should instruct the LLM to return JSON with:
  - `verdict`: "yes", "no", or "partial"
  - `reason`: explanation for the verdict
  - `score`: confidence score 0.0-1.0
