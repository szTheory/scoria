# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-27)

**Core value:** Phoenix teams can add AI runtime governance, visibility, and recovery to an existing app without guessing where Scoria begins, where their app owns identity and policy, or how to verify the integration is working.

**Current focus:** **v2.6 Warning Ratchet** — staged full-suite WAE ratchet + executable baseline expiry (phases 66–69).

## Current Position

Phase: 66 — Baseline Expiry And Inventory (context gathered)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-27 -- Phase 66 planning complete

## Performance Metrics

- **Latest Shipped Milestone:** `v2.5 Installer Safety & Upgrade Confidence` on 2026-05-27
- **Active Milestone:** `v2.6 Warning Ratchet` (phases 66–69)
- **Baseline expiry pressure:** full-suite debt expires `2026-06-07` (`.planning/WARNING-BASELINE.md`)

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- `v2.5` shipped planner/check no-write contracts, manifest-aware drift-safe apply, installer contract SSOT (phases 59–65).
- **v2.6 (active):** `WARN-03`–`WARN-07` staged warning ratchet; executable baseline-expiry CI; preserve lane closeout order.
- **v2.7 (queued):** first Hex publish + README/shipped-state docs-truth.
- `v2.4` lane contracts and CI closeout order remain non-negotiable.

### Evidence (milestone start)

- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` — pass
- `mix test --warnings-as-errors` — fails (knowledge migration redefines, unused vars, LiveView teardown noise, host-proof warnings)
- Canonical lanes — warning-clean (v2.4/v2.5)

## Active Threads

- `.planning/threads/2026-05-27-warning-ratchet-followup.md` — primary execution scope
- `.planning/threads/2026-05-27-milestone-assessment-learnings.md` — graduation candidates for Phase 66 `66-LEARNINGS.md`

## Deferred Items
